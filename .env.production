# Production Environment Variables

# Backend API URL (where your Express server is running)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://cohrrt.thehubitz.com/backend/api

# Socket.IO Server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://cohrrt.thehubitz.com/backend

# Example for local development:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:4000

# For production, you need to:
# 1. Deploy your backend (the /backend folder) to a server
# 2. Make sure it's running on a public URL
# 3. Update these environment variables with that URL

# Possible backend deployment options:
# - Railway.app
# - Render.com
# - Heroku
# - DigitalOcean
# - AWS EC2
# - Your own VPS

# Example if backend is on Railway:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.railway.app/api
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
